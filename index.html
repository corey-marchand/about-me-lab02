        <br>
        <p>
          My name is Corey and I'm a software Developer at Code Fellows.  I was born in St. Louis Missouri and lived half my life on the east Coat and the other half in Washington State.  The brief amount of free time I have I like to occupy it with sports, trading, and working out.

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
              For the forseable future, my goal is to become an efficient coder.  Once I become efficient at coding, I hope to bring value to a company by reducing their code and making it more efficient.  Farther on down the road I hope to own a company that provides value to the public and own investments in reality.
